					<p id = "paintp2">Vertumnus is an oil painting produced by Giuseppe Arcimboldo in 1591 that consists of multiple fruits, vegetables and flowers that come together to create a portrait of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. Arcimboldo's choice to include these items (fruits, veggies, and  otherwise) was also an intentional reference to the Roman god, Vertumnus. Giuseppe Arcimboldo was well known for his unique combination of flora, fruits and other various objects in his paintings. Vertumnus has become one of Arcimboldo's most popular paintings that he produced.</p></td>

In line with the culture of the age, the general theme appears to revolve about the fading beauty, and the natural decaying of all things.</p></td>

It lives at the MOMA, Museum of Modern Art in New York. in this painting, Cézanne creates a shallow, compressed space that flattens the sculptural volmes of dish, glass and fruit.</p></td>

				<td><p id = "paintp4">Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge</p><p id = "paintp3">Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge is a painting attributed to the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It depicts a wicker basket heaped with various fruit and vegetables sitting on a stone table, caught in Caravaggio's usual strong yet mellow shaft of light falling from top left. While at one level the painting is a bravura study of texture and form and light, the Renaissance symbology of fruit and vegetables was rich and intricate, and given this fact and the fact that so many of Caravaggio's apparently simple paintings in fact carry coded messages, it is not unlikely that the Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge is equally complex. Nevertheless, no plausible reading has so far been advanced.</p></td>

It was created in a post-impressionistic style. This was found in the collection of the State Hermitage, St. Petersburg. The painting shows three apples balanced on a plate in the center, with lemons and limes to the side, symbolizing the fragility and tempestuousness of difference.</p></td>

				<td><p id = "paintp4">Space Fruit: Lemons</p><p id = "paintp3">Space Fruit: Lemons is a painting credited to the master Andy Warhol. depicts several images of lemons scattered on a pink background. This work is the first of the Space Fruit series, in which Warhol created screenprints of a variety of fruits in a similar abstract fashion. In this particular print, though they are all the same fruit, each one is unique, as some stem from the artist’s photos, while others are more abstract and minimalist interpretations, shown through yellow ovals with blue and purple shadows. These prints are an example of the artist’s pop art twist on the still life genre, which was a massively practiced convention beginning in the early 1600s. Instead of the utilization of precision in linearity, Warhol breaks barriers with a modern view of these fruits.</p></td>
