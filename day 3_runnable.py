#29 -> "29"

#Variables:

#Rules (required for variables)
#1. NO SPACES
#2. Must start with a letter (no variable can be something like '4chan')
#3. Alphanumeric (can only contain letters and numbers)
#4. Underscored are an exception (your variable could be 'hi_there')

#Conventions (suggested so code is legible)
#1. Descriptive (duckCount could be a variable for a number of ducks)
#2. camelCase -> capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first
    #2b. You could also use underscores as spaces ('cats_are_better_than_dogs')
            #Beware this does take longer
#3. Start with a lowercase letter (usually)

# Challenge
